# Google Doc Clone

This simple project is made to emulate a typical word processor, with multi-user editing in mind.

This project was made with React (vite), Typescript, and Google's Firebase.

The Quill package was used for word processing, Lodash was used for database call throttling, and Firebase was used for authentication (Google sign-in), and database storage.

## Required npm Packages
```
vite
quill
lodash
firebase
```
